# Real-Estate-Property-Listing-Platform

**Real Estate Property Listing Platform**: A platform where users can list their properties for sale or rent. Other users can view listed properties and contact the owner/agent for further details. Use Fluent Validation to validate property details entered by the user. ML.NET can be used to predict the price of a property based on various factors like location, size, amenities, etc.  
Our project was designed and implemented following best practices for Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This approach ensured a well-structured application architecture that facilitates maintenance, scalability, and future development.

By adhering to Clean Architecture principles, the project effectively decouples the system's core logic from external interfaces and infrastructure. This separation allows for easier adaptation to changing technologies and enhances the system's testability  (see our unit and integration tests).
